 Subject: Banned phone number: +15673541518 - Appeal for Account Recovery

Dear Telegram Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Kenan, and I am writing to appeal the suspension of my Telegram account associated with the phone number +15673541518 (US number), email yuxigf@gmail.com, and username @yuxinxxtt.

On September 15, 2025, I suddenly received a message stating that my phone number has been banned, and I am unable to log in or access my account. This account is very important to me for personal communication with family and friends, as well as professional contacts. I have been using Telegram for over 1 year without any prior issues or warnings.

I am not aware of any violation of Telegram's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines. I have never engaged in spamming, sharing illegal content, using unofficial apps, or any suspicious activities. If this was due to a mistaken report or system error, I kindly request a review of my account.

I am committed to following all Telegram rules moving forward and would greatly appreciate your assistance in restoring my access. Please let me know if you need any additional information, such as screenshots of the error message.

Thank you for your time and understanding. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Kenan
